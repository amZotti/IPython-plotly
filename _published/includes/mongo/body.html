       I recently learned about Plotly and used it to make a
       <a href="https://github.com/amZotti/TweetTracker.js" target="_blank">
        awesome data visualizations of Twitter data
       </a>
       .
Plotly is a free web-based platform for making graphs. You can keep graphs private, make them public, and run
       <a href="/product/enterprise/">
        Plotly on your own servers.
       </a>
       Plotly integrates very well with Node.js and MongoDB. I will take this time to discuss how I
configured MongoDB and Plotly together, and how those two entities interacted with each
other. I will be going step by step so you can follow along with me!
